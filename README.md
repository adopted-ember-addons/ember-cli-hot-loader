# Ember-cli-hot-loader

An early look at what hot reloading might look like in the ember ecosystem

## Installation

```
ember install ember-cli-hot-loader
```

During installation Ember CLI will prompt you to update the resolver code. This is required for ember-cli-hot-loader to work. 
If you have never modified the resolver, you can simply accept the changes or do a diff and update it manually. 
The final code should look something like:

```js
import Resolver from 'ember-resolver';
import HotReloadMixin from 'ember-cli-hot-loader/mixins/hot-reload-resolver';

export default Resolver.extend(HotReloadMixin);
```

## How to use this addon

```
note: this project doesn't work yet with ember 2.9 (beta at the moment), but we'll try to fix it before the official release. 
```

After installing it, simply run `ember serve` as usual, any changes you do to supported types, will result in a hotreload (no brower refresh). 
Any additional changes will result in a regular liveReload. 

### Supported Types

At the moment, we only hotreload on component and its templates. 
[ember-cli-styles-reloader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-cli-styles-reloader) will do the styles for you. For support for other 
types you can follow https://github.com/toranb/ember-cli-hot-loader/issues/6 
or help us implement some of those. 

## Example application

To see this in action, you can clone this repo and run `ember serve`.
